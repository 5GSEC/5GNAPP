    Event Details:
    - Source: MobieXpert
    - Name: RRC Null Cipher
    - Cell ID: 20000
    - UE ID: 54649
    - Time: Mon Jun 09 2025 11:28:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)
    - Severity: Critical
    - Description: The UE uses null cipher mode in its RRC session, its RRC traffic data is subject to sniffing attack.
    
response:  **Threat Analysis Report**

**1. Short Summary of the Event:**
MobieXpert detected an "RRC Null Cipher" event for UE ID 54649 connected to Cell ID 20000 at Mon Jun 09 2025 11:28:00 GMT-0400. The event indicates that the User Equipment (UE) was using a null cipher mode for its Radio Resource Control (RRC) session, making its RRC traffic susceptible to sniffing attacks. The severity of this event was flagged as Critical.

**2. Root Cause Analysis of the Event:**
Analysis of the MobiFlow telemetry for UE ID 54649 and Cell ID 20000 reveals the following sequence of events:
The UE initiated an RRC connection establishment procedure, starting with `RRCSetupRequest` and `RRCSetup` messages. During this initial phase, and through the subsequent NAS authentication and security mode command procedures (including `DLInformationTransfer` for `Authenticationrequest` and `Securitymodecommand`, and `ULInformationTransfer` for `Authenticationresponse` and `Securitymodecomplete`), the `rrc_cipher_alg` field in the MobiFlow data was consistently '0'. This value signifies the use of a null cipher algorithm for RRC traffic.

However, immediately following the `SecurityModeComplete` message (MobiFlow entry 47), the `rrc_cipher_alg` transitioned to '1', and the `rrc_sec_state` changed to '3' (SEC_CONTEXT_EXIST). This indicates that RRC ciphering was successfully activated and a security context was established.

Therefore, the "RRC Null Cipher" event observed by MobieXpert corresponds to the standard initial phase of the RRC connection establishment and security setup, where RRC ciphering is not yet active. This is a transient and expected state in 5G New Radio (NR) as per 3GPP specifications.

**3. Security Implication:**
The primary security implication of a null cipher is the exposure of RRC traffic to passive eavesdropping. In this specific instance, the RRC messages exchanged during the initial connection setup, including the `RRCSetupRequest`, `RRCSetup`, `RRCSetupComplete`, and the NAS authentication and security mode command messages, were transmitted without encryption. This means that an attacker capable of sniffing the radio interface during this brief period could have intercepted these unencrypted control plane messages.

However, the MobiFlow telemetry clearly shows that RRC ciphering was successfully activated shortly after the security mode command procedure. This indicates that the period of vulnerability was limited to the initial connection setup phase. While any unencrypted traffic carries a risk, the transient nature of this null cipher state, as part of the standard 5G RRC establishment procedure, mitigates the overall severity. If the null cipher state had persisted beyond the successful completion of the security mode procedure, it would represent a critical and ongoing vulnerability, allowing for continuous sniffing of all RRC user and control plane data. Based on the provided data, the system correctly transitioned to a ciphered state, suggesting that the "Critical" severity might be an alert for any unencrypted RRC traffic, even if it's part of a normal, transient process.
